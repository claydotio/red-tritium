- Test using .publishReplay(1).refCount() in places where a mapped observable is subscribed to multiple times
- Use modularized RxJS
- Figure out a solution to load CSS dynamically and see if it's faster?
- Unrelated to speed, need to swap localStorage with something else in native iOS app (gets cleared too often)
